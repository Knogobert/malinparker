description: 'A critical design that explores what could happen if governments fail to create regulations to stop the global temperature from rising above the 1,5Â° goal.
<br/><br/>
How would it be if the government put all the environmental responsibility on individual citizens?
<br/><br/>
CarbonCurrency explores just that; how it might look like and what consequences could it have.'
