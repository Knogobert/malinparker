# Malin Parker’s Portfolio

The online portfolio for Malin Parker.

## 🎉 Getting Started

1. 📦 Install dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

2. 🏗 Run the project for local dev. This will start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:3000`.

```bash
yarn dev
```

3. 🌌 Build the app for server-side rendered deployment. See more about **Universal SSR** in the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#server-rendered-universal-ssr-).

```bash
yarn build

# And to serve that deployment...
yarn start
```

4. ⚡️ Generate a fully pre-rendered static site. See more [in the docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#static-generated-pre-rendering-).

```bash
yarn generate
```

> This project was bootstrapped with `create-nuxt-app`. There are more detailed explanations of how everything works in the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
