Telia ACE, being the largest customer service platform in the Nordics, caters to clients in both the public and private sectors. While Telia ACE currently offers client tools for web and desktop, it was lacking a mobile work tool.

To maintain Telia ACE’s position as a frontrunner in development a native mobile application was developed for iOS and Android.

In the initial release of the mobile application, all the features present in the existing web application, ACE Mobile Agent, will be mirrored. This ensures a seamless transition for users accustomed to the web interface. The new mobile app, known as ACE To Go, will empower agents by providing essential functionalities on their smartphones.

  Users who will use the mobile application will still often be using the original web system as well. Therefore it is essential that both systems work and look similar, not to confuse users when switching between devices. This was a bit of a challenge because of course, the app also has to follow standards for mobile, as well as work as expected.

  One big feature for the application is the status bar. It displays a lot of information about the users status. For example if their line is open for calls, if they are in a call or on a break etc. We iterated the design of this a lot until we got it right.

  The possibility to transfer call was another feature we iterated and tested several times finding the right solution that worked smootly on mobile. One important thing was the ability to display the queue status for different agents. The transparency helps one transferring the call to chose the most suitable option, which gives value to both for the agents and callers.

  Managing the iOS calling system was challenging as an app is not allowed to handle calls from any other interface than the one that is bult in. To handle this we worked with notifications leading to the caller view, notifying with things like “Go back to call” or “call has been ended, go back for wrap up” etc.
