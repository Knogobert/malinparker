  By maintaining a diary, the intention was to record all work performed, serving as evidence in case of disputes and also facilitating compensation for additional tasks necessitated by changing conditions or unforeseen events. The primary focus was to simplify and enhance the user’s documentation process, making it efficient and accurate. The solution took the form of a responsive Angular web application, allowing users to document their work seamlessly from any device.

  The project involved continuous co-design sessions with actual Peab users, in-depth interviews, and iterative design cycles involving both users and developers. Development closely aligned with Peab’s organisational structure, and a pilot phase was conducted with select Peab projects before proceeding to the next stage. The project followed an agile approach, with ongoing prioritisation of features based on their value and effort.

  The most significant challenge was integrating the system with the existing SharePoint infrastructure and Azure authentication. Additionally, the solution needed to accommodate various project types and user profiles while maintaining simplicity, clarity, and efficiency.
